<h1>Best Movies According to Laura</h1>
<h2>A list of movies that left an impression.</h2>
<p>Can be seen as the only movies I remember, because it's been age since I've actually seen a movie.</p>

<h3>1. Spy x Family</h3>
    <p>This is the only movie I've watched in the past three months. It was pretty good! It was very well-animated, and the music was really good. I enjoy animated action movies, so this was within my favorite genre.</p>

<h3>2. Mission Impossible Part 1</h3>
    <p>This is the only other movie I've watched recently. It was very loud and hurt my ears, but the music itself was something I appreciated. The brass and woodwinds meshed so well together, and I could feel the intensity of each scene precisely because the music aided with the entire atmosphere. I wish they turned down the speakers though.</p>
