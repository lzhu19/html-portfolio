<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Laura Zhu is a student computer scientist and musician. She has the most experience in web development, but is open to learning new things in the computer science field. In the music field, Laura has a solid music foundation with 14 years of experience. She started on the piano, then later explored other instruments like the guitar, ukulele, recorder, flute, and piccolo, the last two being her main instruments. On the music side of things, she composed a couple short pieces and one long composition before delving into music made electronically on modern music softwares.</p>

<p>Computer science was always fascinating to her. How is something like a computer programmed? How do calculators work? How do video games process inputs and respond in a way that appeals to the player? Those questions sparked her passion for learning more about coding languages and how they can be applied to various things. Laura started by creating websites like this one, playing around with HTML and CSS in a team of four with other student programmers. Her team created Snaptask, a website designed to inform users about procrastination and suggest solutions to combat the bad habit of setting things aside for later. Then, she embarked on a journey to learn Python by undergoing an AI Mentorship and learning about machine learning and how to train models to predict trends in data. She used a spotify database to determine what factors of songs contribute most to their popularity. After going through linear, decision tree, and random forest regressors, Laura found that song artists play a big role in the popularity of songs, along with the genre and the duration.</p>

<p>Laura has a strong interest in music after playing instruments and writing music for so long. She has interest in combining her experienced skillset in music with her solid foundation in coding to create an intruiging mix of both, some ideas being rhythm games, AI that can prevent other AI from stealing any form of art, and new instruments.</p>
